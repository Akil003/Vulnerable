        <p class="my-4">Cyber security is necessary to protect personal data, networks,
          and personal systems from unauthorized access and protect data from misuse. Cyber security
          consists of technologies, processes and measures that are designed to protect systems,
          networks, and data damage from cybercrimes. Effective cyber security reduces the risk of a
          successful cyberattack and protects data, organizations and individuals from the planned misuse
          of systems, networks and technologies. Every year many individuals and organizations suffer
          from cyberattacks, which include data loss, information hacks, transaction problem, and
          unauthorized access of information or data. The frequency of these attacks is increasing day by
          day and it's creating a lot of problems or threats in our life. These attacks can be extremely
          damaging to businesses as well as people. Therefore, we must know about cyberattacks and their
          preventive measures as many of us are still unaware about it. The objective of this paper is to
          create awareness of the various types of cyber-attacks and lay the foundation for their cyber
          security planning</p>
